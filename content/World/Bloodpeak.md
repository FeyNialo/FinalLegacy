Between being inhabited by the bloodthirsty Orcs, and situated at the base of the Firegrave Volcano, not many people dare venture to this city, let alone those that return to tell the tale of it.

What is known is that the city is built on a system of Kratocracy, where the those who are strong enough to seize power rule, and at the heart of the city lies an arena where those who are foolhardy enough to believe themselves strong can test themselves against the strongest the settlement has to offer.
