The Cities of Experiments, these two cities are used by the Gnomes as their home when the other is caught in a particularly bad experiment. Currently Tinkerholm is the city housing this species, with the other lying in mostly ruins, with ominous black holes and void-gates having taken hold in Buildersreach after the Head Researcher of the Gnomes took a look too far into the Void. 

Although almost inhospitable, there is a small settlement of people residing within Buildersreach, outcasts from various towns and villages in the area.

After defeating the self-proclaimed 'Lord', the party have now gained a foothold in the area, and are now free to explore what lies within the rubble of these ruins.
