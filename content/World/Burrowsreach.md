Once residing in Buildersreach, these peaceful folk were evicted by their neighbours after an experiment gone awry caused the Gnomes to flock to the Halfling's settlement, eventually taking it over. After a long and grueling journey the smallfolk eventually settled in  a calm and tranquil valley, and started anew in Burrowsreach. A sprawling interconnected system of tunnels and passages allow for all homes to be connected in some way, and by using technology stolen from the dwarves, small automated vehicles can be used to travel between the districts.
