Placed upon the largest of the Floating Isles, the city of Skyhaven and its populace of Aarakocra distance themselves from the plights and troubles of the grounded species, rarely accepting visitors, rarer still tolerating their presence. Commanding a fleet of air vessels and dirigibles, it is not uncommon for the big cities of the continent to have an air harbour specifically to host these crafts, as the trade and rare minerals they bring are invaluable to the cities lucky enough to have one visit them.
