Isolated by both sea and tempest, Stormforge is a mountain city built in the towering pinnacle of Setever. The dwarves have used both magic and technology to hollow out the insides of the mountain, creating a vast and sprawling settlement that is inhabited by an untold amount of blacksmiths and forgers. It's said that as you ascent the inside of the peak, the quality of these craftsmen increase, and towards the summit lies the Dwarven Lord, a dwarf so powerful his every hammer-strike causes volcanoes around the island to simmer and boil over.
