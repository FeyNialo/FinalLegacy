The City of Discovery, this city has been responsible for most of the major discoveries since the last incursion almost a century ago. It's towering battlements and steeples are iconic in their representation of the heights it's students and citizens strive to reach. A large portion of the city is taken up by an academy that boasts some of the brightest and most intelligent of humans, where the other half seems almost to only exist to provide for those that reside within the academy. Not much is known about the origin of the city, but legend tells of an ancient necropolis, ruins of a bygone age when the powerful ruled with an iron fist, lying beneath Falconspire.
